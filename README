PREREQUISITES
	-> Python-2.4 or newer (http://www.python.org/)
	-> NumPy-1.0 (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
	-> SciPy-0.5.1 (http://www.scipy.org/)
	-> Matplotlib-0.90.1 or newer (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
	-> MADAGASCAR-2817 (SVN developer tree at http://rsf.sourceforge.net/)
			Note: Compile with API=python,c++,f90,matlab (only python API is required)
	-> [OPTIONAL] SCons-0.96.95 or newer (http://www.scons.org/)
			Note: It is optional and only required to run SConstruct script.



INSTALLATION NOTES
	-> [Preferred] Just put this folder (Charm) into your $PYTHONPATH. 
		For example, if you are using BASH and $Charm is the path to your 
		Charm folder, then type:
			export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$Charm
		For CShell:
			setenv PYTHONPATH $PYTHONPATH:$Charm

	-> Alternatively, you may use setup.py to install the package in your 
		default python path location, enter this command:
			python setup.py install
	-> To install it into a specific folder type this, where /path/to/mypython 
	   is a folder which is in your $PYTHONPATH environment.
			python setup.py install --install-lib=/path/to/mypython
	
	
	-> Set environment variables(paths) if they are different than default values. 
		These variables are CHARM_Data,CHARM_Results,CHARM_pydata,CHARM_Demos. 
		Otherwise it will be set to defaults which are folders with 
		the same name (Data, Results, and etc.) in $Chamrpy as mentioned above.
		
		For example, if you are using BASH and $DataPATH is the path where you have 
		input rsf data, then type:
			export CHARM_Data=$PYTHONPATH:$DataPATH
		For CShell:
			setenv CHARM_Data $PYTHONPATH:$DataPATH
		
	-> Global variable "_df_input" in __init__.py points to default input rsf file 
		for some of the functions of this package. For your convenience, it is 
		better to be set to a sample rsf file in order to skip declaring it in 
		input argument
				
RUNNING THE PACKAGE IN PYTHON
	-> Go into your python interpreter.
	-> Type "import Charm" at your python command prompt.


PROCESSING WITH STDIN & STDOUT:
	Use following commands in terminal to analyze seismic data and show results
	-> ./sfchar.py <input.rsf >output.rsf args=...
	-> ./sfshow.py <results.rsf           args=...
		Note: Arguments are optional and will be set to default if not provided. 
		For more details about arguments check the scripts header for documentation
